 # Hey, I’m Alberto

I am an ICU nurse who also spends a lot of time building and running my own home infrastructure.

I manage a small Kubernetes cluster, a set of self-hosted apps, NFS storage on a Synology NAS, reverse proxy routing with SSL, and identity management through Authentik. None of this started as a job move, I just like making things work the way I want, and over time it turned into a full environment that feels a lot like a real production setup.

My clinical work taught me how to stay calm, think clearly, and fix problems when things get stressful.  
My homelab taught me how to design and maintain systems that stay stable even when life gets chaotic.

Now I am putting both sides together as I move into the tech world.

## About me

I am a critical care RN with a strong interest in systems, tooling, and automation.  
I like building things that feel solid, understandable, and repairable when they fail.
